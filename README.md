# Hate-Speech-Detection

🧠 Twitter Hate Speech Detection
This project focuses on detecting hate speech and offensive language in tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset contains 24,000+ tweets labeled as hate speech, offensive language, or neither, and the goal is to build a classification model that can accurately distinguish between them.

🔍 Key Features
Text preprocessing: cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations such as:
Word clouds
Class distribution
Tweet length distribution
Most frequent words per class
Modeling using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
Evaluation with confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

📊 Objective
To develop a model that can classify tweets into:
0 → Hate Speech
1 → Offensive Language
2 → Neither

This project demonstrates how NLP and ML techniques can be applied to help moderate and understand toxic content on social platforms.
